### logon-event-logging
example of mof runner and VBS script that stores event recor into ADODB resource and sends message via MS Exchange
Managed Object Format (MOF) is CIM classes that one can use in WMI  
At first I tried to put all the logic inside a MOF but it's tricky thing due to formatting  
So the way to use a runner to execute external script looks better
